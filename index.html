        <h2>PFOS/PFOA Background Info</h2>
        <p>This web map portal focuses on mapping data related to two specific types of PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances): PFOS (Perfluorooctane Sulfonate) and PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid). We chose these two PFAS compounds because they are the most abundant pollutants. PFAS are a group of man-made chemicals that have been widely used in industrial and consumer products, including firefighting foams, non-stick cookware, and water-repellent fabrics. These chemicals are persistent in the environment and have been linked to serious health concerns, such as cancer, liver damage, and immune system effects.</p>

        <h2>PWSID Info</h2>
        <h3>What is a PWSID?</h3>
        <p>On this website, you will see references to PWSID, which stands for Public Water System Identification number. This unique identifier is assigned to each public water system (PWS) and is used to track water quality data, including the presence of PFAS. Mapping PWSID-related data helps us visualize where PFAS contamination is occurring and how it may impact different communities across Massachusetts.</p>

    <section class="why-map">
        <h2>Why Map Schools?</h2>
        <p>Mapping schools in relation to PFAS contamination is a critical aspect of this project because schools are places where children spend a significant portion of their time. Children are more vulnerable to the harmful effects of environmental toxins like PFAS due to their developing bodies and higher intake of water relative to their body weight.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Protect Children's Health:</strong> Identifying schools near PFAS hotspots allows for targeted actions to ensure that the water and environment around these schools are safe.</li>
            <li><strong>Inform School Administrators and Parents:</strong> Providing school administrators, staff, and parents with clear, accessible data about PFAS risks can help them make informed decisions about mitigating exposure.</li>
            <li><strong>Prioritize Remediation Efforts:</strong> Mapping schools helps prioritize areas for remediation and monitoring, ensuring that resources are directed to where they are most needed to protect children's health.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="why-map-income">
        <h2>Why Map Median Income?</h2>
        <p>Mapping median income alongside PFAS contamination data provides critical insights into the socio-economic dimensions of environmental justice. Median income is a key indicator of a community's ability to mobilize resources, advocate for clean water, and implement protective measures.</p>
        <p>By analyzing the correlation between median income and PFAS contamination, we can identify patterns that reveal which areas may be disproportionately affected by pollution due to economic constraints.</p>
        <p>This layer of analysis helps us understand the broader context of PFAS pollution and highlights the need for targeted support and policies that ensure all communities, regardless of economic status, have the resources necessary to protect their health and environment.</p>
